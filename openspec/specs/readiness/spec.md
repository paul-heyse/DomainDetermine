# readiness Specification

## Purpose

Ensure every release maintains operational readiness by enforcing comprehensive automated suites, preserving evidence, and surfacing regressions with actionable telemetry so deployments remain auditable and reversible.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Deployment Pipeline Governance

Deployments SHALL run through automated pipelines enforcing build, readiness tests, approval, and rollout stages with rehearsed rollback procedures and recorded evidence.

#### Scenario: Approval-gated rollout

- **WHEN** a release candidate is promoted to staging
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL enforce sign-off from designated approvers before production rollout, storing approvals, timestamps, and scope in the governance registry.

#### Scenario: Rollback rehearsal logged

- **WHEN** monthly rollback drills occur
- **THEN** teams SHALL execute documented rollback procedures, record duration, outcome, and gaps; failed rehearsals SHALL block production releases until remediation is captured.

#### Scenario: Stage order enforced

- **WHEN** a deployment pipeline executes
- **THEN** it SHALL execute build → readiness tests → staging promotion → approval gate → production rollout in sequence, aborting if any stage fails or is skipped.

### Requirement: Readiness Test Coverage

The program SHALL maintain readiness suites (unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, security) that exercise every critical capability prior to release.

#### Scenario: Integration suites cover cross-module flows

- **WHEN** a release candidate is prepared
- **THEN** the integration suite SHALL execute ingest → plan → map → audit → eval flows using pinned fixtures, failing the release if any step regresses.

#### Scenario: End-to-end workflows guarded

- **WHEN** the nightly readiness pipeline runs
- **THEN** full CLI and service flows SHALL run against staging infrastructure, collecting manifests, metrics, and publishing a signed readiness report.

#### Scenario: Performance SLO enforcement

- **WHEN** performance tests detect latency exceeding SLO thresholds
- **THEN** the deployment SHALL be blocked until mitigation is documented and approved.

### Requirement: Configuration & Release Documentation

Every deployment SHALL produce a release manifest detailing artifacts, configuration deltas, migrations, and rollback plans, including secrets/feature-flag management steps.

#### Scenario: Release manifest archived

- **WHEN** production rollout completes
- **THEN** the release manifest with artifact hashes, feature-flag enablement plan, secrets rotation evidence, and rollback procedures SHALL be archived and linked to monitoring dashboards.

#### Scenario: Migration evidence retained

- **WHEN** schema or data migrations run
- **THEN** dry-run results, validation checks, and rollback scripts SHALL be attached to the manifest.

#### Scenario: Feature flags staged

- **WHEN** new feature flags are introduced
- **THEN** the manifest SHALL capture staged rollout cohorts, monitoring hooks, and rollback criteria.

### Requirement: Readiness Evidence & Reporting

All readiness executions SHALL produce machine-readable artifacts (scorecards, logs, metrics) pinned in the governance registry for audit and rollback.

#### Scenario: Scorecards persisted

- **WHEN** readiness suites complete
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate a readiness scorecard summarizing pass/fail status, coverage, and risk, and persist it with hash + version references.

#### Scenario: Alerting on readiness regressions

- **WHEN** any readiness checkpoint fails
- **THEN** alerts SHALL notify maintainers with root-cause context and link to failing artifacts.

### Requirement: Telemetry-Gated Deployment

Production deployments SHALL consume readiness telemetry (OpenTelemetry metrics & spans) to enforce approval gates before rollout.

#### Scenario: Deployment gate enforces thresholds

- **WHEN** a deployment request reaches the approval gate
- **THEN** the gate SHALL query readiness scorecards and OTEL metrics (latency, error rate, flake rate), rejecting the release if thresholds are breached or waivers absent.

#### Scenario: Governance registry logs telemetry references

- **WHEN** a deployment artifact is registered
- **THEN** the manifest SHALL include the readiness run id, scorecard hash, and trace ids, enabling auditors to trace telemetry evidence.

### Requirement: Readiness Governance & Change Control

Readiness configurations, thresholds, waivers, and change boards SHALL be governed artifacts with documented approvals, roles, and expiry tracking.

#### Scenario: Waiver expiry blocks deploy

- **WHEN** a readiness waiver reaches its expiration before deployment
- **THEN** the system SHALL block release until the waiver is renewed or readiness evidence demonstrates mitigation.

#### Scenario: Threshold change review

- **WHEN** an engineer proposes altering readiness thresholds
- **THEN** the change SHALL require dual review, produce a changelog entry, and trigger a validation run before activation.

#### Scenario: Change board matrix maintained

- **WHEN** change board membership updates
- **THEN** the environment approval matrix SHALL be updated within five business days and referenced from the deployment runbook.

#### Scenario: Waiver lifecycle captured

- **WHEN** a waiver is granted for a readiness gap
- **THEN** its expiry, mitigation plan, and approvals SHALL be recorded; expired waivers block releases.

### Requirement: Observability, Training, and Incident Response

Readiness pipelines SHALL emit standardized telemetry (latency, pass rate, flake rate, cost), expose dashboards, enforce incident templates, and maintain deployment training materials.

#### Scenario: Telemetry export

- **WHEN** readiness suites finish executing
- **THEN** the system SHALL publish metrics to the observability stack with labels for suite type, tenant, and git revision.

#### Scenario: Alerting on telemetry drift

- **WHEN** flake rate or latency exceeds defined SLOs outside maintenance windows
- **THEN** alerts SHALL page the readiness owners and annotate the current release with a `READINESS_AT_RISK` status in the registry.

#### Scenario: Training curriculum enforced

- **WHEN** new engineers receive deployment permissions
- **THEN** they SHALL complete the deployment & rollback training within two weeks, with completion recorded in the readiness registry.

#### Scenario: Incident response templates enforced

- **WHEN** an incident related to readiness occurs (failed deploy, test outage)
- **THEN** responders SHALL use the standard incident template capturing timeline, root cause, remediation, and archive it within 48 hours.
