## 1. Specification & Approval

- [ ] 1.1 Inventory required external integrations (ticketing, chatops, SIEM, cost analytics, automated runbooks) per module/workspace.
- [ ] 1.2 Align security, compliance, operations, and automation teams on integration scope, data retention, and approval workflows.
- [ ] 1.3 Produce integration design docs (sequence diagrams, data flow, authentication) for review.

## 2. Integration Contract Design

- [ ] 2.1 Define webhook/event schemas for incident escalations, waiver approvals, readiness exceptions, and automations triggered from GUI.
- [ ] 2.2 Specify chatops commands, slash commands, and notification format for GUI alerts.
- [ ] 2.3 Document ticketing connector behaviors (create/update/close), mapping GUI actions to external systems, and fallback CLI commands.
- [ ] 2.4 Establish cost analytics API usage, sampling cadence, and threshold evaluation logic.

## 3. Implementation

- [ ] 3.1 Build integration adapters (HTTP/webhook clients, chatops connectors, ticketing clients) with retry/backoff, authentication, secrets rotation, and feature flag gating.
- [ ] 3.2 Implement configuration management (per-tenant secrets, template files) and admin UI for integration endpoints.
- [ ] 3.3 Wire GUI dashboards and incident workspace to integration services, including acknowledgement synchronization, status polling, and error handling.
- [ ] 3.4 Provide CLI scripts and Python utilities for testing integrations and fallback operations.
- [ ] 3.5 Implement runbook synchronization service that monitors external knowledge base updates, refreshes GUI links, logs changes, and exposes status in admin UI.

## 4. Security, Compliance & Runbooks

- [ ] 4.1 Conduct security assessment of external integrations (scopes, secrets, rate limits), update risk register, and define monitoring policies.
- [ ] 4.2 Document runbooks for integration failures, secrets rotation, and incident workflows; synchronize with knowledge base and in-GUI help.
- [ ] 4.3 Implement audit logging and compliance reporting for external actions (ticket creation, chat notifications, SIEM alerts).
- [ ] 4.4 Validate runbook synchronization accuracy (change detection, access auditing) and implement monitoring/alerts for stale links or sync failures.

## 5. Testing & Validation

- [ ] 5.1 Develop integration tests/mocks for ticketing/chatops/SIEM/cost analytics connectors.
- [ ] 5.2 Run end-to-end simulations of escalation workflows, waiver approvals, and SLA-triggered actions.
- [ ] 5.3 Validate fallback behavior (CLI parity) when integrations are disabled or unavailable.
- [ ] 5.4 Execute `openspec validate add-gui-ops-integration --strict`.
