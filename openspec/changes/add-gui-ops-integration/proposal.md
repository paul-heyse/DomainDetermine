## Why
The GUI operations change introduces extensive reviewer, observability, and governance workflows, but it relies on cross-system integrations (ticketing, chatops, SOAR/SIEM, cost analytics, readiness pipelines) that require explicit adapters and policies. A dedicated change is needed to define integration contracts, automation hooks, and runbook synchronization so the GUI can interoperate with external operational tooling and existing Python automation scripts.

## What Changes
- Define integration contracts for incident/ticketing systems (e.g., PagerDuty, Jira), chatops (Slack/Teams), SIEM/SOC feeds, and cost analytics to allow GUI dashboards and workbenches to automate escalation and reporting.
- Establish webhook/event schemas and command templates for GUI-triggered automations, ensuring parity with CLI scripts and governance runbooks.
- Provide configuration and secret management guidelines for external tool connectors, including per-tenant overrides and feature flag gating.
- Document operational runbooks, SOP synchronization, versioning, and training flows between GUI and external knowledge bases.
- Extend observability and compliance reporting pipelines to collect GUI-specific metrics, alert acknowledgements, and incident outcomes, feeding both GUI and external systems.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `gui`, `service`, `governance`, `readiness`, `prompt-pack`, operations documentation.
- Affected code: integration adapters (webhooks, chatops connectors, ticketing clients), configuration templates, documentation updates, automation scripts, secret management policies.
