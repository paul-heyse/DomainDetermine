## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Readiness Test Coverage
The program SHALL maintain readiness suites (unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, security) that exercise every critical capability prior to release.

#### Scenario: Integration suites cover cross-module flows
- **WHEN** a release candidate is prepared
- **THEN** the integration suite SHALL execute ingest → plan → map → audit → eval flows using pinned fixtures, failing the release if any step regresses.

#### Scenario: End-to-end workflows guarded
- **WHEN** the nightly readiness pipeline runs
- **THEN** full CLI and service flows SHALL run against staging infrastructure, collecting manifests, metrics, and publishing a signed readiness report.

#### Scenario: Performance SLO enforcement
- **WHEN** performance tests detect latency exceeding SLO thresholds
- **THEN** the deployment SHALL be blocked until mitigation is documented and approved.

### Requirement: Readiness Evidence & Reporting
All readiness executions SHALL produce machine-readable artifacts (scorecards, logs, metrics) pinned in the governance registry for audit and rollback.

#### Scenario: Scorecards persisted
- **WHEN** readiness suites complete
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate a readiness scorecard summarizing pass/fail status, coverage, and risk, and persist it with hash + version references.

#### Scenario: Alerting on readiness regressions
- **WHEN** any readiness checkpoint fails
- **THEN** alerts SHALL notify maintainers with root-cause context and link to failing artifacts.
