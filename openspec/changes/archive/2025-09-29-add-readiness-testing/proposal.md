## Why

Our stack lacks a unified readiness framework covering end-to-end flows, performance, and security regression checks. Without a formalized testing capability we risk shipping regressions that break cross-module flows or violate SLO/SLA commitments.

## What Changes

- Define a readiness testing capability covering unit, integration, e2e, performance, and security suites with gating thresholds.
- Introduce automation guidelines (CI orchestration, nightly runs, fail-fast policies) and artifact retention rules for evidence.
- Require readiness scorecards and dashboards to surface coverage and risk signals before deployment.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `readiness/testing`, `governance`, `observability`
- Affected code: test harnesses, CI configuration, telemetry exporters, documentation
