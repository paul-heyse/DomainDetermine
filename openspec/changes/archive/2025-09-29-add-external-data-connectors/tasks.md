## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Catalogue connector requirements from `AI-collaboration.md` and map to supported formats, endpoints, and licensing scenarios.
- [x] 1.2 Define configuration schema (YAML/CLI) covering credentials, throttles, caching, delta detection, and license policies per source.
- [x] 1.3 Specify telemetry & observability contracts (logs, metrics, traces) for each connector, including failure modes and retries.
- [x] 1.4 Describe validation & testing harnesses: golden fixtures, contract tests, integration suites for file parsers and SPARQL endpoints.
- [x] 1.5 Draft governance & documentation requirements (manifests, runbooks, onboarding checklists, incident response).
