## Why
Module 6 needs detailed governance over item types, grader contracts, metrics, runner execution, reporting, and ethical controls to ensure evaluation fidelity and trustworthiness.

## What Changes
- Specify grader contracts across deterministic, human, and LLM judging modes.
- Define metric frameworks, acceptance thresholds, and statistical treatments.
- Document runner architecture, telemetry, reporting deliverables, and governance policies (versioning, bias, access).

## Impact
- Affected specs: eval-blueprint
- Affected code: Grader registry, metric calculators, runner adapters, reporting pipelines, governance hooks.
