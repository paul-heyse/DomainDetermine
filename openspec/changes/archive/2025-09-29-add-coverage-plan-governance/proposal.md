## Why
We need to define the governance, output artifacts, and quality controls for the coverage planner so that generated plans are auditable, versioned, and performant before the implementation stage begins.

## What Changes
- Introduce requirements for LLM-assisted refinements with human-in-the-loop quality gates.
- Define the authoritative coverage plan outputs, diagnostics, and reporting expectations.
- Specify versioning, diff, rollback, performance, and testing standards for coverage plans.

## Impact
- Affected specs: coverage-planner
- Affected code: Coverage Planner output writers, auditing dashboards, governance registry hooks
