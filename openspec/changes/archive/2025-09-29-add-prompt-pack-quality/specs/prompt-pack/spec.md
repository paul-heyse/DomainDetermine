## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Calibration Assets
The prompt pack SHALL maintain calibration datasets and yardsticks for critical templates (judges, proposals, critiques) with human-reviewed answers to benchmark performance.

#### Scenario: Missing calibration set
- **WHEN** a judge template lacks an associated calibration dataset
- **THEN** the quality pipeline SHALL block deployment of the template update until calibration assets are provided

### Requirement: Automated Validation Checks
Prompt outputs SHALL pass automated validation covering schema adherence, citation correctness, grounding fidelity, and hallucination detection before being accepted downstream.

#### Scenario: Schema validation failure
- **WHEN** a prompt output fails schema validation or citation checks
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the response, log the failure, and (if applicable) trigger re-generation or escalate for review

### Requirement: Quality Metrics Tracking
The system SHALL capture per-template metrics (constraint adherence, grounding fidelity, hallucination rate, human acceptance, cost, latency) with trend analytics and alerting for regressions.

#### Scenario: Metric regression
- **WHEN** grounding fidelity for a template drops below the configured threshold
- **THEN** alerts SHALL fire and the governance process SHALL evaluate rollback or remediation
