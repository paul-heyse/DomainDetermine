## Why

While individual modules export metrics, there is no cohesive observability readiness capability ensuring monitoring, alerting, and recovery are aligned with release criteria. This gap leaves on-call responders without consistent dashboards, SLO tracking, or incident workflows.

## What Changes

- Specify an observability readiness capability covering metrics, logging, tracing, alerting, and incident response.
- Define telemetry packages required per module and cross-system dashboards (readiness scorecard, cost, latency, error budgets).
- Establish incident runbooks, on-call rotations, and post-incident review processes tied to governance.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `readiness/observability`, `telemetry`, `governance`
- Affected code: metrics exporters, logging configuration, alert definitions, documentation
