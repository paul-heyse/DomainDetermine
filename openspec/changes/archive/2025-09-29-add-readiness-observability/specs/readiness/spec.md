## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Observability Baseline
Every production environment SHALL expose a readiness dashboard pack that covers service/API health, async job throughput, LLM cost and latency, governance event rates, and readiness scorecards, with data sources auto-wired from the environment manifest.

#### Scenario: Dashboards deployed
- **WHEN** a new environment is provisioned
- **THEN** the observability stack SHALL deploy the baseline dashboards (service, jobs, LLM, governance, readiness) within 15 minutes, parameterized with the environment’s telemetry endpoints.

#### Scenario: Alert thresholds enforced
- **WHEN** error rate, latency, cost, or queue depth exceed defined SLO budgets
- **THEN** paging alerts SHALL trigger the on-call rotation with runbook links, mitigation checklists, and live dashboard context.

### Requirement: Metrics & SLO Coverage
Each module (ingest, coverage planner, mapping, overlay, auditor, eval, service, CLI, LLM runtime) SHALL export a readiness telemetry bundle including SLO status, coverage %, cost per run, latency distributions, queue depth, and error budget burn, aggregated hourly and retained for 90 days.

#### Scenario: Module metrics reported
- **WHEN** any module completes a readiness pipeline run
- **THEN** it SHALL emit metrics covering success rate, p95 latency, cost, queue depth, and backlog age with labels for tenant, environment, run id, and artifact hashes.

#### Scenario: Error budget tracking
- **WHEN** burn rate for a module exceeds 2× the budgeted threshold over one hour
- **THEN** the readiness dashboard SHALL surface a `BURN_ALERT` badge and emit an incident-level page.

### Requirement: Logging & Retention Policies
Readiness observability SHALL standardize structured logging (JSON) with fields for trace_id, tenant, artifact_id, command, outcome, and SHALL define sampling and retention: 30 days hot, 180 days warm, with PII scrubbing before export.

#### Scenario: Structured log enforcement
- **WHEN** readiness commands run in CLI or service workflows
- **THEN** logs SHALL emit JSON payloads containing trace_id, tenant, command, fingerprint, outcome, duration_ms, and error fields; non-compliant logs SHALL fail CI checks.

#### Scenario: Retention policy applied
- **WHEN** log storage hits the 30-day window
- **THEN** hot logs SHALL roll to warm storage with PII fields redacted or hashed, and retention manifests SHALL be written to the governance registry.

### Requirement: Tracing & Instrumentation
Critical readiness paths (CLI verbs, scheduler jobs, service endpoints, LLM provider calls) SHALL emit distributed traces with standardized spans and attributes (tenant, artifact_id, upstream hashes, cost tokens) and propagate context across async boundaries.

#### Scenario: Trace propagation
- **WHEN** a readiness workflow triggers downstream jobs or LLM calls
- **THEN** span context SHALL propagate so traces show CLI → service → worker → LLM relationships with timing, retries, and token usage metadata.

#### Scenario: Instrumentation gaps detected
- **WHEN** instrumentation coverage falls below 95% of readiness workflows in nightly sampling
- **THEN** the observability readiness checks SHALL fail and block release until coverage is restored.

### Requirement: Incident Response Integration
Incident handling SHALL follow standardized runbooks, integrate with governance event logs, and produce postmortem artifacts linked to readiness metrics, including automated timeline capture and remediation tracking.

#### Scenario: Incident logging
- **WHEN** an incident is declared
- **THEN** responders SHALL log key events, decisions, remediation steps, and associated trace/log links, with final artifacts archived in the governance registry and linked to readiness dashboards.

#### Scenario: Postmortem review
- **WHEN** an incident closes
- **THEN** a postmortem SHALL be completed within 72 hours, updating readiness dashboards with action items, owning teams, due dates, and tracking status until closure.
