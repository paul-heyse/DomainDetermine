## Why
We lack formalized deployment and rollback procedures across CLI, service layer, and job orchestration. Without explicit readiness gates we risk inconsistent releases, human error, and unclear rollback responsibilities.

## What Changes
- Introduce a deployment readiness capability covering automated pipelines, rollout approvals, and rollback drills.
- Define artifact promotion flows, configuration management discipline, and release documentation requirements.
- Establish audit trails for deployments, including change scopes, approvers, and rollback rehearsals.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `readiness/deployment`, `governance/versioning`
- Affected code: CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts, runbooks, governance registry integrations
