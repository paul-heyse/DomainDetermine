## 1. Specification & Approval

- [x] 1.1 Document calibration asset requirements, validator expectations, and quality KPIs in the spec.

## 2. Implementation

- [x] 2.1 Curate calibration datasets and acceptance yardsticks for judge/proposal templates.
- [x] 2.2 Implement automated validators for schema adherence, grounding, and hallucination detection.
- [x] 2.3 Instrument pipelines to log quality metrics and persist results with version metadata.

## 3. Observability & Alerts

- [x] 3.1 Build dashboards and alerts for quality KPIs (grounding fidelity, hallucination rate, cost, latency).
- [x] 3.2 Integrate alerts with governance review workflows.

## 4. Testing & Validation

- [x] 4.1 Expand calibration/quality tests (`tests/test_mapping_calibration.py`, `tests/test_mapping_policy.py`).
- [x] 4.2 Run `pytest -q` for prompt-pack modules.
- [x] 4.3 Execute `openspec validate add-prompt-pack-quality --strict`.
