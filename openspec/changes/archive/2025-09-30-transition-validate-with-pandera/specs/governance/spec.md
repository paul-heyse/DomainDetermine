## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Governance Registry Scope

The system SHALL maintain a governance registry that treats KOS snapshots, Coverage Plans, mapping/crosswalk outputs, overlay schemes, evaluation suites, prompt packs, run bundles, and signed certificates as first-class, versioned artifacts validated with Pydantic models.

#### Scenario: Registry object creation

- **WHEN** a new governed artifact is produced
- **THEN** the registry SHALL assign a globally unique identifier within the appropriate namespace, record artifact type, semantic version, content hash, creator, timestamp, and validate the manifest against the appropriate Pydantic schema before persisting.

### Requirement: Artifact Metadata Schema

The registry SHALL capture for every artifact a manifest containing upstream references (with IDs and hashes), policy pack hash, license tag, human-readable title, change reason code, reviewer approvals, waiver IDs, and environment fingerprint (runtime versions, container digests), enforcing schema integrity with Pydantic models.

#### Scenario: Manifest stored with upstream pins

- **WHEN** an artifact is published
- **THEN** its manifest SHALL include references to all upstream artifact IDs and hashes (e.g., Coverage Plan â†’ KOS snapshot), validate successfully via the manifest Pydantic schema, and persist the manifest as part of the registry record.
