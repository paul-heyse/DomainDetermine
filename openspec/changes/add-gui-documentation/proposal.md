## Why
The GUI introduces new workflows, integrations, and operational policies across the DomainDetermine platform. To ensure successful adoption and compliance, we must produce comprehensive documentation, runbooks, training content, and change management assets aligned with the proposals for foundation, architecture, operations, backend support, adapters, and integrations. Without this work, operators and reviewers will lack guidance, and audits will fail to confirm process adherence.

## What Changes
- Create a centralized GUI documentation hub covering information architecture, workspace guides, walkthroughs, FAQ, and change logs, linked to existing DomainDetermine docs.
- Author runbooks, SOPs, and incident playbooks for each workspace and integration, ensuring they are accessible within the GUI and external knowledge bases.
- Develop training curricula (videos, exercises, quizzes) for operators, reviewers, governance leads, and incident responders, tracking completion and acknowledgements.
- Produce onboarding checklists, release notes, and communication plans for GUI rollout across tenants, including risk assessments and feedback loops.
- Update compliance artifacts (policies, audit evidence templates, waiver records) to reflect GUI workflows and integration contracts.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `gui`, `governance`, `readiness`, documentation guides.
- Affected code/docs: documentation repository, GUI contextual help assets, training content, onboarding workflows, compliance templates.
