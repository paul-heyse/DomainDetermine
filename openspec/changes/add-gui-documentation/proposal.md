## Why
The GUI introduces new workflows, integrations, and operational policies across the DomainDetermine platform. To ensure successful adoption and compliance—while keeping everything inside our Python ecosystem—we must produce comprehensive documentation, runbooks, training content, and change-management assets that reference the FastAPI + NiceGUI implementation. Without this work, operators and reviewers will lack guidance, and audits will fail to confirm process adherence.

## What Changes
- Create a centralized GUI documentation hub covering information architecture, workspace guides, walkthroughs, FAQ, and change logs, highlighting Python-native libraries and deployment patterns.
- Author runbooks, SOPs, and incident playbooks for each workspace and integration, ensuring they are accessible within the GUI and external knowledge bases, with instructions tied to Python scripts/CLI fallbacks.
- Develop training curricula (videos, exercises, quizzes) for operators, reviewers, governance leads, and incident responders, tracking completion and referencing Python tooling (NiceGUI components and FastAPI clients).
- Produce onboarding checklists, release notes, and communication plans for GUI rollout across tenants, including risk assessments and feedback loops informed by Python deployment processes.
- Update compliance artifacts (policies, audit evidence templates, waiver records) to reflect GUI workflows, integration contracts, and Python-specific implementation details.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `gui`, `governance`, `readiness`, documentation guides.
- Affected code/docs: documentation repository, GUI contextual help assets, training content, onboarding workflows, compliance templates, references to Python components.
