## Why
Module 6 requires a foundational specification so that evaluation suites are derived consistently from coverage plans with clear inputs and outputs.

## What Changes
- Capture mission and definition of done for the eval blueprint generator.
- Document the required inputs, outputs, and data contracts for Module 6 artifacts.
- Outline the base tasks to initialise deterministic suite scaffolding.

## Impact
- Affected specs: eval-blueprint
- Affected code: Eval suite manifest builder, schema generation, grader registry, runner configuration.
