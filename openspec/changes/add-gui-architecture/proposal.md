## Why
A modular GUI requires deep integration with each DomainDetermine module (ingestion, coverage planner, mapping, overlay, auditor, evals, readiness, prompt pack, governance, service operations) to expose complex workflows, data contracts, and human-in-the-loop queues. Architectural planning is needed to define workspace boundaries, data flows, consistency with existing services/CLI, and support observability, feature rollout, multi-tenant governance, and disaster recovery at scale.

## What Changes
- Design dedicated GUI workspaces for every capability (modules 1â€“7, readiness, prompt pack, governance, service ops) ensuring CLI parity, module guardrails, SLAs, and audit checkpoints.
- Define backend orchestration, event streaming, state management, caching, search, and automation patterns for jobs, telemetry, artifacts, reviewer queues, prompt pack calibration, readiness gates, service health, and release processes.
- Establish shared design system, layout primitives, data access policies, infrastructure components, feature flag controls, and extensibility model handling RBAC, tenancy isolation, offline resilience, CLI interoperability, and tenant extensions.
- Describe data synchronization between GUI, services, prompt pack runtime, readiness telemetry, governance registry, CLI automation, and external artifacts, including caching tiers, drift detection, idempotent mutations, schema versioning, and observability hooks.
- Enumerate security, observability, compliance, and extensibility constraints the architecture must satisfy (websocket fallbacks, streaming logs, manifest signatures, policy enforcement, automation integration).

## Impact
- Affected specs: `kos-ingestion`, `coverage-planner`, `mapping`, `overlay`, `auditor`, `readiness`, `prompt-pack`, `service`, `governance`, new `gui` capability.
- Affected code: new GUI workspaces, backend adapters, search/index components, event bus integrations, prompt pack/readiness dashboards, CLI automation hooks, documentation/design assets.
