## Why
The existing tooling requires operators to rely on CLI commands and raw manifests, limiting adoption, visibility, and human-in-the-loop workflows. A first-class GUI is needed to surface the DomainDetermine pipeline end-to-end with guardrails, replacing ad-hoc scripts and reducing operational toil. The foundation must enforce governance, security, accessibility, observability, and parity with existing CLI/service behavior so subsequent modules can build on a stable, scalable surface aligned with DomainDetermineâ€™s Python codebase and data contracts.

## What Changes
- Introduce a browser-based GUI framework that wraps governance registry, job orchestration, artifact browsers, telemetry, notifications, and search with RBAC-aligned navigation, tenant isolation, and user preference management.
- Deliver dashboards that surface pipeline health, artifact lineage, outstanding actions, incident banners, cost telemetry, and saved views without invoking CLI, including drill-down, export, and automation hooks.
- Implement shared UI components (layout, theming, navigation, notifications, command palette, global search, contextual help, inbox, user settings, offline messaging) that integrate with existing services and support localization, accessibility, and security policies.
- Establish API contracts, auth/session flows, caching policies, telemetry standards, error handling, and feature flag strategies between the GUI and backend services, including websocket fallback, offline resilience, and CLI parity.
- Define non-functional baselines (performance budgets, accessibility criteria, browser/device matrix, telemetry instrumentation standards, threat model) and update documentation for operators and reviewers.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `service`, `governance`, `readiness`, `prompt-pack`, `gui` capability.
- Affected code: new `DomainDetermine.gui` package, updates to API services/streaming adapters, telemetry/logging integrations, security middleware, user preference storage, documentation/runbooks/onboarding materials.
