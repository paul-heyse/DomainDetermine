## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Reviewer Workbench

The GUI SHALL include a reviewer workbench—built with NiceGUI components backed by FastAPI services—consolidating mapping adjudications, overlay approvals, eval failure reviews, readiness waivers, and prompt pack calibration checks with evidence context, keyboard navigation, offline resilience, and batch operations.

#### Scenario: Mapping reviewer adjudicates case

- **WHEN** a reviewer selects an ambiguous mapping
- **THEN** the workbench SHALL display source text, candidate metadata, LLM rationale, allow selecting decisions or deferrals with reason codes, and persist outcomes to the governance registry.

#### Scenario: Readiness waiver approval

- **WHEN** a readiness owner reviews a failing gate within the workbench
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL surface suite metrics, telemetry snapshots, allow approve/reject with justification, and post the decision to readiness telemetry and governance logs.

### Requirement: Governance & Waiver Management

The GUI SHALL expose governance workflows (waiver submission, approval, manifest signing, rollout/rollback, delegated approvals) with RBAC enforcement, audit logging, and feature-flagged rollout per tenant, delivered through Python-native UI components and FastAPI adapters.

#### Scenario: Approve coverage certificate waiver

- **WHEN** an operator with approval role reviews a waiver
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL display supporting evidence, capture signature and justification, update the governance registry, emit audit events, and reflect status in the dashboard.

#### Scenario: Release manifest promotion

- **WHEN** a release manager promotes a manifest via the GUI
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL validate required approvals, readiness gates, policy checks, capture signatures, trigger automation hooks, and persist the promotion to the governance registry with rollback instructions.

### Requirement: Observability Dashboards

The GUI SHALL surface operational dashboards—implemented with NiceGUI visualization components and FastAPI data adapters—for LLM usage, job queue health, readiness gates, cost tracking, security alerts, SOC incidents, and reviewer throughput, supporting alert thresholds, integrations (PagerDuty/Slack), and drill-down to raw logs.

#### Scenario: LLM cost overrun alert

- **WHEN** cost metrics exceed thresholds
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL highlight the overrun, link to offending jobs/prompts, provide remediation actions (adjust parameters, pause workflows), and allow acknowledgement with audit trail.

#### Scenario: Readiness gate regression

- **WHEN** a readiness suite fails a gating threshold
- **THEN** the dashboard SHALL flag the failure, link to the relevant suite run, allow opening a waiver review, and notify subscribed teams.

#### Scenario: Job queue backlog alert

- **WHEN** ingestion or mapping job queues exceed SLA thresholds
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL raise an alert, expose queue length/age charts, provide quick links to pause or re-prioritize jobs, and record operator acknowledgement for auditing.

### Requirement: Deployment, Automation & Release Controls

Operations SHALL provide automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD) with blue-green/canary release support, feature flag management, automation/webhook hooks, health checks, rollback scripts, disaster recovery procedures, and documentation accessible within the Python-native GUI.

#### Scenario: GUI release pipeline executed

- **WHEN** a new GUI version is deployed
- **THEN** the pipeline SHALL run automated tests, perform staged rollout, monitor health metrics, expose status in the admin console, and offer an instant rollback if readiness checks fail.

#### Scenario: Shadow deployment validation

- **WHEN** the GUI is deployed in shadow/read-only mode to staging tenants
- **THEN** the platform SHALL route mirrored traffic, collect performance metrics, surface discrepancies without impacting production, and record readiness results before general availability.

### Requirement: Security, Compliance & Retention

The GUI SHALL enforce session security (MFA, inactivity timeout, device fingerprinting, audit trails), track compliance status per tenant, surface security alerts to administrators, integrate with SOC tooling, and enforce retention/archival policies for GUI-generated artifacts (annotations, decisions, incident notes) using Python middleware and libraries.

#### Scenario: Session timeout handling

- **WHEN** a session exceeds inactivity threshold
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL log out the user, prompt re-authentication, and log the event with actor metadata.

#### Scenario: Suspicious activity alert

- **WHEN** anomalous access patterns or policy violations are detected
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL notify security administrators, provide contextual evidence, and allow remediation steps (lock account, revoke sessions).

#### Scenario: Artifact retention enforcement

- **WHEN** annotations or incident notes exceed the configured retention window
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL queue archival/cleanup tasks, tag the artifacts with retention status, and emit audit events confirming compliance.

### Requirement: Incident Management & Runbooks

The GUI SHALL provide an incident workspace—implemented via Python-native components—aggregating alerts, playbooks, and mitigation actions, integrating with SOC systems (SIEM, ticketing) for escalation, acknowledgement, and post-incident reviews.

#### Scenario: Incident escalation workflow

- **WHEN** a SOC alert is received via the GUI integration
- **THEN** the incident workspace SHALL display the alert, offer runbook and mitigation links, allow assignment/escalation, capture acknowledgement, and synchronize status with external ticketing systems while logging actions for audit.

### Requirement: Training, Onboarding & Automation Hooks

The GUI SHALL embed contextual help, runbook links, guided tours, automation hooks (copy-as-CLI, webhooks), and onboarding experiences for operators—implemented within Python-native frameworks—ensuring parity with CLI automation and capturing training acknowledgements.

#### Scenario: Reviewer opens runbook

- **WHEN** a reviewer selects “View SOP” within the workbench
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL open the relevant runbook section, display latest revision, and log that the guidance was accessed.

#### Scenario: Copy action as CLI command

- **WHEN** an operator views job parameters in the GUI
- **THEN** the GUI SHALL provide a “copy as CLI” option that mirrors OperationExecutor usage, including flags and dry-run options, for automation parity.
