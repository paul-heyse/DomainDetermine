## 1. Specification & Approval

- [x] 1.1 Capture reviewer workbench requirements across mapping, overlay, eval, readiness, and prompt pack modules (evidence, metrics, reason codes, offline behavior). (See `design.md` reviewer workbench section.)
- [x] 1.2 Align governance, readiness, security, and operations teams on GUI-based sign-off workflows, delegation, incident handling, and SOC integrations. (Documented via governance and operations sections in `design.md`.)
- [x] 1.3 Produce operating model document covering roles, escalation paths, incident response, and support expectations for GUI rollout. (Outlined in `design.md` deliverables and risks.)

## 2. Reviewer Workbench Implementation

- [ ] 2.1 Build unified review queue UI using the NiceGUI framework with evidence panels, calibration context, reason codes, bulk actions, and offline resilience.
- [ ] 2.2 Integrate mapping, overlay, eval adjudication, and readiness waiver flows with governance registry updates and telemetry hooks.
- [ ] 2.3 Add calibration/pilot tracking, acceptance metrics visualization, prompt pack health indicators, and readiness gate summaries.
- [ ] 2.4 Implement guided tours, SOP links, and contextual help for reviewer workflows.

## 3. Governance, Incident, & Compliance

- [ ] 3.1 Expose waiver management, signature capture, readiness gate attestations, release manifest promotion/rollback, and policy audit workflows inside GUI with RBAC and feature flags.
- [ ] 3.2 Implement delegated approvals, rollbacks, publishing actions, CLI parity checks, and automation hooks (webhooks, copy-as-CLI) with audit trails and trace IDs.
- [ ] 3.3 Ensure audit logging captures GUI actions with actor, reason, trace IDs, and propagates to governance event log, SIEM/SOC tooling, ticketing systems, and compliance reporting pipelines.
- [ ] 3.4 Implement incident workspace with alert listings, playbook links, assignment/escalation workflows, chatops/ticketing integrations, and capture post-incident reviews/lessons.
- [ ] 3.5 Coordinate compliance reporting (export logs, waiver stats, policy attestations, residency records), align with security runbooks, and produce operator onboarding/training assets.
- [ ] 3.6 Establish retention policies for GUI-generated artifacts (annotations, decisions, incident notes) and schedule archival/cleanup automation aligned with governance requirements.
- [ ] 3.7 Implement session security controls (MFA enforcement, device posture checks, configurable inactivity timeout, context-aware warnings) and verify audit logging for all security events.
- [ ] 3.8 Validate security controls with penetration tests and document remediation workflows in `docs/gui/security_runbook.md`.

## 4. Observability & Operations

- [ ] 4.1 Instrument GUI for telemetry (usage, errors, LLM cost, readiness gates, security events, SOC alerts) and integrate with existing dashboards/alerts.
- [ ] 4.2 Define alerting policies for GUI failures, job queue anomalies, cost overruns, readiness regressions, and security incidents; document response playbooks and escalation paths.
- [ ] 4.3 Automate deployments (CI/CD, blue-green/canary, feature flag rollout, rollback scripts) and document runbooks + disaster recovery drills.
- [ ] 4.4 Add admin console showing release status, feature flag states, readiness health, incident summaries, and current alerts.
- [ ] 4.5 Validate feature flag rollout strategy (progressive exposure, fallback paths) across staging and pilot tenants.

## 5. Testing & Validation

- [ ] 5.1 Conduct end-to-end validation of reviewer and incident workflows with beta users; capture UAT feedback and runbook alignment.
- [ ] 5.2 Run security, accessibility, performance, resilience, offline, feature-flag, and incident-simulation testing with sign-offs.
- [ ] 5.3 Validate governance/telemetry contracts through integration tests, SOC logging review, readiness gate replays, and incident simulations.
- [ ] 5.4 Execute `openspec validate add-gui-operations --strict`.
- [ ] 5.5 Deliver training sessions, updated SOP videos, and knowledge checks for reviewers/governance teams; collect acknowledgement.
- [ ] 5.6 Trial production shadow deployments (read-only/staging tenants) and measure operational load before general availability.
