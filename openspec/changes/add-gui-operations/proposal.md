## Why

Operating the GUI at scale requires governance integrations, observability, deployment automation, security operations, bookkeeping, and reviewer tooling. A comprehensive plan is needed to manage HITL workflows, alerting, multi-tenant access, cost tracking, release processes, training, documentation, and integration with existing automation frameworks now that the GUI replaces CLI interactions across modules.

## What Changes

- Deliver a reviewer workbench embedded in the GUI for mapping, overlay, coverage auditor, eval adjudication, prompt pack calibration, readiness gates, and policy reviews with role-specific views, SLA tracking, collaboration, escalation workflows, and retention tagging.
- Integrate governance registry actions (signatures, waivers, releases, readiness attestations, deployment gates, policy audits, manifest promotion/rollback) directly into the GUI with audit compliance, RBAC, automation hooks (webhooks/copy-as-CLI), retention policies, and CLI parity.
- Add observability dashboards, cost accounting, alerting, incident response triggers, compliance reporting, ticketing/chatops integrations, and shadow deployment monitoring tailored to GUI usage (LLM calls, job failures, queue delays, cost overruns, security events, waiver backlog).
- Define deployment/release pipelines, blue-green/rolling upgrades, feature flag rollout, rollback procedures, chaos/resiliency drills, disaster recovery plans, A/B testing, and shadow deployments for GUI services with runbooks and readiness criteria.
- Provide security controls (MFA, session policies, device posture, secrets hygiene), compliance reports, retention/archival automation, training programs, onboarding checklists, and documentation updates for operators and reviewers.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `mapping`, `overlay`, `auditor`, `governance`, `readiness`, `prompt-pack`, `service`, `gui`, supporting ops tooling.
- Affected code: reviewer workbench components, governance API integrations, observability dashboards, incident workspace tooling, automation/ticketing adapters, CI/CD scripts, security configuration, documentation/training assets.
