## Why

Operating the GUI at scale requires governance integrations, observability, deployment automation, security operations, bookkeeping, and reviewer tooling. By building these experiences with NiceGUI atop FastAPI services, we maintain parity with existing code, reuse domain models, and deliver high-attractiveness interfaces without fragmenting the stack. A comprehensive plan is needed to manage HITL workflows, alerting, multi-tenant access, cost tracking, release processes, training, documentation, and automation frameworks now that the GUI replaces CLI interactions.

## What Changes

- Deliver a reviewer workbench embedded in the Python-based GUI for mapping, overlay, coverage auditor, eval adjudication, prompt pack calibration, readiness gates, and policy reviews with role-specific views, SLA tracking, collaboration, and escalation workflows.
- Integrate governance registry actions (signatures, waivers, releases, readiness attestations, deployment gates, policy audits) directly into the GUI with audit compliance, RBAC, automation hooks, and CLI parity, leveraging Python components and FastAPI endpoints.
- Add observability dashboards, cost accounting, alerting, incident response triggers, compliance reporting, and ticketing/chatops connectors implemented with Python adapters and NiceGUI visual components.
- Define deployment/release pipelines, blue-green/rolling upgrades, feature flag rollout, rollback procedures, chaos/resiliency drills, DR plans, and A/B testing for the Python GUI services. Document runbooks and readiness criteria.
- Provide enhanced security controls (MFA, session policies, device posture validation, secrets hygiene), compliance reports, training programs, onboarding checklists, and documentation updatesâ€”all maintained within Python tooling.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `mapping`, `overlay`, `auditor`, `governance`, `readiness`, `prompt-pack`, `service`, `gui`, supporting ops tooling.
- Affected code: reviewer workbench components (NiceGUI), FastAPI governance integrations, observability dashboards, automation/ticketing adapters, CI/CD scripts, security configuration, documentation/training assets.
